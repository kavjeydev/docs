## JavaScript Setup

### Installation

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @react/trainly
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @react/trainly
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @react/trainly
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  The JavaScript SDK works in both Node.js and browser environments with
  automatic environment detection.
</Note>

### Basic Usage

```javascript
import { TrainlyClient } from "@react/trainly";

// Initialize the client
const trainly = new TrainlyClient({
  apiKey: "tk_your_api_key_here",
  chatId: "chat_abc123",
});

// Ask a question
async function queryKnowledgeBase() {
  const response = await trainly.query({
    question: "What are the main findings?",
  });

  console.log("Answer:", response.answer);
  console.log("Citations:", response.context);
}

queryKnowledgeBase();
```

### TypeScript Support

The SDK is written in TypeScript with full type definitions:

```typescript
import { TrainlyClient, QueryResponse, UploadResponse } from "@react/trainly";

const trainly = new TrainlyClient({
  apiKey: process.env.TRAINLY_API_KEY!,
  chatId: process.env.TRAINLY_CHAT_ID!,
});

// Fully typed response
const response: QueryResponse = await trainly.query({
  question: "What is the methodology?",
  model: "gpt-4o-mini",
  temperature: 0.7,
});

// TypeScript knows all available fields
console.log(response.answer);
console.log(response.context[0].score);
console.log(response.usage.total_tokens);
```

## Python Setup

### Installation

<CodeGroup>

```bash pip
pip install trainly
```

```bash poetry
poetry add trainly
```

</CodeGroup>

### Basic Usage

```python
from trainly import TrainlyClient

# Initialize the client
trainly = TrainlyClient(
    api_key="tk_your_api_key_here",
    chat_id="chat_abc123"
)

# Ask a question
response = trainly.query(
    question="What are the main findings?"
)

print("Answer:", response.answer)
print("Citations:", len(response.context))

# Access context details
for i, chunk in enumerate(response.context):
    print(f"Citation [{i}]: {chunk.chunk_text[:100]}... (score: {chunk.score})")
```

### Type Hints

The Python SDK includes full type hints for better IDE support:

```python
from trainly import TrainlyClient, QueryResponse, ChunkScore
from typing import List

trainly = TrainlyClient(
    api_key="tk_your_api_key",
    chat_id="chat_abc123"
)

# Fully typed response
response: QueryResponse = trainly.query(
    question="What is the conclusion?",
    model="gpt-4o",
    temperature=0.5,
    max_tokens=2000
)

# Access typed fields
answer: str = response.answer
context: List[ChunkScore] = response.context
tokens: int = response.usage.total_tokens
```

## Environment Variables

For better security, use environment variables for your credentials:

<CodeGroup>

```bash .env
TRAINLY_API_KEY=tk_your_api_key_here
TRAINLY_CHAT_ID=chat_abc123
```

```javascript JavaScript
import { TrainlyClient } from "@react/trainly";
import dotenv from "dotenv";

dotenv.config();

const trainly = new TrainlyClient({
  apiKey: process.env.TRAINLY_API_KEY,
  chatId: process.env.TRAINLY_CHAT_ID,
});
```

```python Python
import os
from trainly import TrainlyClient

trainly = TrainlyClient(
    api_key=os.getenv("TRAINLY_API_KEY"),
    chat_id=os.getenv("TRAINLY_CHAT_ID")
)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Quick Examples

### File Upload

<CodeGroup>

```javascript JavaScript
// Upload a file
const uploadResult = await trainly.uploadFile({
  file: "./research_paper.pdf",
  scopeValues: {
    project_id: "proj_123",
    category: "research",
  },
});

console.log("Uploaded:", uploadResult.filename);
console.log("File ID:", uploadResult.file_id);
```

```python Python
# Upload a file
with open('research_paper.pdf', 'rb') as file:
    upload_result = trainly.upload_file(
        file=file,
        scope_values={
            'project_id': 'proj_123',
            'category': 'research'
        }
    )

print(f"Uploaded: {upload_result.filename}")
print(f"File ID: {upload_result.file_id}")
```

</CodeGroup>

### Streaming Responses

<CodeGroup>

```javascript JavaScript
// Stream responses in real-time
for await (const chunk of trainly.queryStream({
  question: "Explain the methodology in detail",
})) {
  if (chunk.type === "content") {
    process.stdout.write(chunk.data);
  } else if (chunk.type === "end") {
    console.log("\n\nStream complete!");
  }
}
```

```python Python
# Stream responses in real-time
for chunk in trainly.query_stream(
    question="Explain the methodology in detail"
):
    if chunk.type == 'content':
        print(chunk.data, end='', flush=True)
    elif chunk.type == 'end':
        print('\n\nStream complete!')
```

</CodeGroup>

### List Files

<CodeGroup>

```javascript JavaScript
// Get all files in chat
const files = await trainly.listFiles();

console.log(`Total files: ${files.total_files}`);
console.log(`Total size: ${formatBytes(files.total_size_bytes)}`);

files.files.forEach((file) => {
  console.log(`- ${file.filename} (${file.chunk_count} chunks)`);
});
```

```python Python
# Get all files in chat
files = trainly.list_files()

print(f"Total files: {files.total_files}")
print(f"Total size: {format_bytes(files.total_size_bytes)}")

for file in files.files:
    print(f"- {file.filename} ({file.chunk_count} chunks)")
```

</CodeGroup>

### Delete Files

<CodeGroup>

```javascript JavaScript
// Delete a specific file
const deleteResult = await trainly.deleteFile(
  "v1_user_xyz_document.pdf_1609459200",
);

console.log(`Deleted ${deleteResult.filename}`);
console.log(`Freed ${formatBytes(deleteResult.size_bytes_freed)}`);
```

```python Python
# Delete a specific file
delete_result = trainly.delete_file(
    'v1_user_xyz_document.pdf_1609459200'
)

print(f"Deleted {delete_result.filename}")
print(f"Freed {format_bytes(delete_result.size_bytes_freed)}")
```

</CodeGroup>

## V1 OAuth Authentication

For user-facing applications with OAuth:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript JavaScript
import { TrainlyV1Client } from "@react/trainly";

// User authenticates with their OAuth provider
const userToken = await getUserOAuthToken(); // Your OAuth implementation

// Initialize V1 client with user's token
const trainly = new TrainlyV1Client({
  userToken: userToken,
  appId: "app_your_app_id",
});

// Query user's private data
const response = await trainly.query({
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "What is in my documents?" }],
});

console.log(response.answer);
```

```python Python
from trainly import TrainlyV1Client

# User authenticates with their OAuth provider
user_token = get_user_oauth_token()  # Your OAuth implementation

# Initialize V1 client with user's token
trainly = TrainlyV1Client(
    user_token=user_token,
    app_id="app_your_app_id"
)

# Query user's private data
response = trainly.query(
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is in my documents?"}
    ]
)

print(response.answer)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Error Handling

Always wrap API calls in try-catch blocks:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript JavaScript
try {
  const response = await trainly.query({
    question: "What is the conclusion?",
  });

  console.log(response.answer);
} catch (error) {
  if (error.status === 429) {
    console.error("Rate limit exceeded. Please wait and retry.");
  } else if (error.status === 401) {
    console.error("Invalid API key");
  } else if (error.status === 400) {
    console.error("Bad request:", error.message);
  } else {
    console.error("Error:", error.message);
  }
}
```

```python Python
from trainly.exceptions import (
    RateLimitError,
    AuthenticationError,
    ValidationError
)

try:
    response = trainly.query(
        question="What is the conclusion?"
    )
    print(response.answer)

except RateLimitError:
    print("Rate limit exceeded. Please wait and retry.")
except AuthenticationError:
    print("Invalid API key")
except ValidationError as e:
    print(f"Bad request: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

</CodeGroup>

## Configuration Options

Both SDKs support extensive configuration:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript JavaScript
const trainly = new TrainlyClient({
  apiKey: "tk_your_api_key",
  chatId: "chat_abc123",

  // Optional configurations
  baseUrl: "https://api.trainly.com",
  timeout: 30000, // 30 seconds
  maxRetries: 3,
  retryDelay: 1000, // 1 second

  // Default query options
  defaultModel: "gpt-4o-mini",
  defaultTemperature: 0.7,
  defaultMaxTokens: 1000,
});
```

```python Python
trainly = TrainlyClient(
    api_key="tk_your_api_key",
    chat_id="chat_abc123",

    # Optional configurations
    base_url="https://api.trainly.com",
    timeout=30.0,  # 30 seconds
    max_retries=3,
    retry_delay=1.0,  # 1 second
