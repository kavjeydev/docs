## Overview

Trainly provides a comprehensive GraphRAG (Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation) API that enables you to build intelligent applications with privacy-first document processing and AI-powered question answering.

## API Architecture

The Trainly API is organized into several major categories:

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Authentication Methods

Trainly supports multiple authentication approaches depending on your use case:

### 1. V1 Trusted Issuer Authentication (Recommended)

For external applications that want to integrate with Trainly while maintaining complete user privacy:

```bash
# User authenticates with their OAuth provider (Clerk, Auth0, etc.)
# Your app gets an ID token from the OAuth provider
# Send that token to Trainly for validation

curl -X POST https://api.trainly.com/v1/me/chats/query \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <USER_OAUTH_ID_TOKEN>" \
  -H "X-App-ID: app_your_app_id" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"messages": "[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What is AI?\"}]"}'
```

<Note>
  With V1 auth, users maintain complete control over their data. Files are
  stored in permanent private subchats that only they can access.
</Note>

### 2. Chat API Keys

For direct chat access with API keys:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.trainly.com/v1/{chat_id}/answer_question \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer tk_your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What are the main findings?"}'
```

### 3. Privacy-First OAuth (Legacy)

For applications requiring stricter privacy controls:

```bash
# Step 1: Get authorization URL
# Step 2: User authorizes
# Step 3: Exchange code for token
# Step 4: Use token for queries
```

## Base URLs

<CodeGroup>

```bash Production
https://api.trainly.com
```

```bash Development
http://localhost:8000
```

</CodeGroup>

## Rate Limiting

All API endpoints are rate-limited to ensure fair usage:

- **Default**: 60 requests per minute per API key
- **Streaming**: 30 requests per minute per API key

Rate limit headers are included in all responses:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 60
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 59
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1609459200
```

## Response Format

All API responses follow a consistent JSON format:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    // Response data
  },
  "error": null
}
```

Error responses include detailed information:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "data": null,
  "error": {
    "code": "INVALID_REQUEST",
    "message": "Invalid chat_id format",
    "details": {}
  }
}
```

## Privacy Guarantees

Trainly is built with privacy at its core:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="User Data Isolation">
    Each user's data is stored in isolated subchats. Developers can only access AI-generated responses, never raw files or documents.
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Citation Filtering">
  Citations are automatically filtered based on the access method. Direct user
  access gets full citations, while developer API calls get limited snippets.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Audit Logging">
  All access attempts are logged for security and compliance purposes.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="GDPR/CCPA Compliance">
    Users maintain ownership of their data and can request deletion at any time.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
