## Installation

Install the Trainly SDK using pip or poetry:

<CodeGroup>

```bash pip
pip install trainly
```

```bash poetry
poetry add trainly
```

```bash pipenv
pipenv install trainly
```

</CodeGroup>

## Quick Start

```python
from trainly import TrainlyClient

# Initialize the client
trainly = TrainlyClient(
    api_key="tk_your_api_key",
    chat_id="chat_abc123"
)

# Ask a question
response = trainly.query(
    question="What are the main findings?"
)

print("Answer:", response.answer)
print("Citations:", len(response.context))
```

## Initialization

### Basic Configuration

```python
from trainly import TrainlyClient
import os

trainly = TrainlyClient(
    api_key=os.getenv("TRAINLY_API_KEY"),
    chat_id=os.getenv("TRAINLY_CHAT_ID")
)
```

### Initialization with Environment Variables

Use environment variables for secure credential management:

```python
from trainly import TrainlyClient
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load environment variables from .env file
load_dotenv()

# Get credentials from environment
api_key = os.getenv("TRAINLY_API_KEY")
chat_id = os.getenv("TRAINLY_CHAT_ID")

if not api_key or not chat_id:
    raise ValueError("TRAINLY_API_KEY and TRAINLY_CHAT_ID must be set")

client = TrainlyClient(api_key=api_key, chat_id=chat_id)

print(f"Client initialized with chat_id: {client.chat_id}")
print(f"Base URL: {client.base_url}")
print(f"Timeout: {client.timeout}s")
```

### Initialization with Validation

Validate client initialization:

```python
from trainly import TrainlyClient
import os

def initialize_client():
    """Initialize and validate Trainly client"""
    api_key = os.getenv("TRAINLY_API_KEY")
    chat_id = os.getenv("TRAINLY_CHAT_ID")

    if not api_key or not chat_id:
        raise ValueError("TRAINLY_API_KEY and TRAINLY_CHAT_ID must be set")

    try:
        client = TrainlyClient(api_key=api_key, chat_id=chat_id)
        print(f"✓ Client initialized successfully")
        print(f"  Chat ID: {client.chat_id}")
        return client
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"✗ Initialization failed: {e}")
        raise

# Usage
client = initialize_client()
```

### Advanced Configuration

```python
from trainly import TrainlyClient
import logging

trainly = TrainlyClient(
    api_key="tk_your_api_key",
    chat_id="chat_abc123",

    # API Configuration
    base_url="https://api.trainlyai.com",
    timeout=30.0,  # Request timeout in seconds

    # Retry Configuration
    max_retries=3,
    retry_delay=1.0,  # Initial delay in seconds
    retry_backoff=2.0,  # Exponential backoff multiplier

    # Default Query Options
    default_model="gpt-4o-mini",
    default_temperature=0.7,
    default_max_tokens=1000,

    # Logging
    debug=False,
    logger=logging.getLogger(__name__)
)
```

## Querying Documents

### Basic Query

```python
from trainly import TrainlyClient

trainly = TrainlyClient(
    api_key="tk_your_api_key",
    chat_id="chat_abc123"
)

# Ask a question
response = trainly.query(
    question="What is the main conclusion?"
)

# Access response fields
print("Answer:", response.answer)
print("Model:", response.model)
print("Tokens used:", response.usage.total_tokens)

# Access citations
for i, chunk in enumerate(response.context):
    print(f"[{i}] {chunk.chunk_text[:100]}...")
    print(f"    Relevance: {chunk.score * 100:.1f}%")
```

### Advanced Query Options

```python
response = trainly.query(
    question="Explain the methodology in detail",

    # Model Selection
    model="gpt-4o",  # or 'claude-3-opus', 'gpt-4-turbo', etc.
    temperature=0.3,  # Lower = focused, Higher = creative
    max_tokens=2000,  # Maximum response length

    # Custom Instructions
    custom_prompt="You are a research analyst. Provide detailed technical explanations with citations.",

    # Scope Filtering
    scope_filters={
        "project_id": "proj_123",
        "version": "2.0",
        "category": "research"
    }
)

print(response.answer)
```

### Query Without Context

Sometimes you may want to query without including context chunks in the response. This is useful when you only need the answer:

```python
from trainly import TrainlyClient

trainly = TrainlyClient(
    api_key="tk_your_api_key",
    chat_id="chat_abc123"
)

# Query without context chunks
response = trainly.query(
    question="What are the findings?",
    include_context=False  # Don't return context chunks
)

print("Answer:", response.answer)
print("Context chunks returned:", len(response.context))  # Will be 0
```

### Query with Custom Parameters

Fine-tune your queries with specific parameters:

```python
response = trainly.query(
    question="Explain the key concepts",
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    temperature=0.7,
    max_tokens=500,
    include_context=True
)

print(f"Model used: {response.model or 'default'}")
print(f"Answer preview: {response.answer[:100]}...")
```

### Type Hints

```python
from trainly import TrainlyClient, QueryResponse, ChunkScore
from typing import List, Dict, Any

trainly = TrainlyClient(
    api_key="tk_your_api_key",
    chat_id="chat_abc123"
)

# Fully typed response
response: QueryResponse = trainly.query(
    question="What are the results?",
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    temperature=0.7
)

# Access typed fields
answer: str = response.answer
context: List[ChunkScore] = response.context
tokens: int = response.usage.total_tokens

# Iterate with type hints
chunk: ChunkScore
for chunk in response.context:
    chunk_id: str = chunk.chunk_id
    text: str = chunk.chunk_text
    score: float = chunk.score
```

## Streaming Responses

### Basic Streaming

```python
# Stream responses in real-time
for chunk in trainly.query_stream(
    question="Summarize all the key points"
):
    if chunk.type == "content":
        print(chunk.data, end="", flush=True)
    elif chunk.type == "context":
        print(f"\n\nUsing {len(chunk.data)} citations")
    elif chunk.type == "end":
        print("\n\nComplete!")
```

### Streaming with Content Collection

Collect streaming content and verify completion:

```python
from trainly import TrainlyClient, StreamChunk

trainly = TrainlyClient(
    api_key="tk_your_api_key",
    chat_id="chat_abc123"
)

chunks = []
content_parts = []

for chunk in trainly.query_stream("Explain the methodology"):
    chunks.append(chunk)

    if chunk.is_content:
        content_parts.append(chunk.data)
    elif chunk.is_end:
        print("Received end marker")

# Verify we received content
assert len(chunks) > 0, "Should receive at least one chunk"
assert any(chunk.is_end for chunk in chunks), "Should receive end marker"

full_content = "".join(content_parts)
assert len(full_content) > 0, "Should receive content"

print(f"Total chunks received: {len(chunks)}")
print(f"Content length: {len(full_content)} characters")
```

### Advanced Streaming with Progress

```python
from trainly import TrainlyClient
from rich.console import Console
from rich.progress import Progress, SpinnerColumn, TextColumn

console = Console()
trainly = TrainlyClient(
    api_key="tk_your_api_key",
    chat_id="chat_abc123"
)

def stream_query(question: str):
    """Stream query with fancy progress display"""

    with Progress(
        SpinnerColumn(),
        TextColumn("[progress.description]{task.description}"),
        console=console
    ) as progress:
        task = progress.add_task("Generating response...", total=None)

        answer = ""

        for chunk in trainly.query_stream(question=question):
            if chunk.type == "content":
                answer += chunk.data
                console.print(chunk.data, end="")
            elif chunk.type == "end":
                progress.update(task, description="Complete!")
                break

        return answer

# Usage
answer = stream_query("What are the key findings?")
console.print(f"\n\nFinal answer length: {len(answer)} characters")
```

### Async Streaming

```python
import asyncio
from trainly import AsyncTrainlyClient

async def stream_query_async():
    trainly = AsyncTrainlyClient(
        api_key="tk_your_api_key",
        chat_id="chat_abc123"
    )

    async for chunk in trainly.query_stream(
        question="Explain the results"
    ):
        if chunk.type == "content":
            print(chunk.data, end="", flush=True)
        elif chunk.type == "end":
            print("\n\nDone!")

# Run async function
asyncio.run(stream_query_async())
```

## File Management

### Upload Files

```python
# Upload from file path
with open("research_paper.pdf", "rb") as file:
    result = trainly.upload_file(
        file=file,
        filename="research_paper.pdf",
        scope_values={
            "project_id": "proj_123",
            "category": "research",
            "version": 1.0
        }
    )

print(f"Uploaded: {result.filename}")
print(f"File ID: {result.file_id}")
print(f"Size: {result.size_bytes} bytes")

# Upload from bytes
file_bytes = b"This is my document content..."
result = trainly.upload_file(
    file=file_bytes,
    filename="notes.txt",
    scope_values={"type": "notes"}
)
```

### Upload from File Path (Simplified)

You can also upload directly from a file path:

```python
import tempfile
import os

# Create a temporary test file
with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode='w', suffix='.txt', delete=False) as f:
    f.write("This is a test document for Trainly SDK testing.\n")
    f.write("It contains multiple lines of text.\n")
    f.write("The content should be searchable after upload.")
    temp_path = f.name

try:
    # Upload the file
    result = trainly.upload_file(temp_path)

    assert result.success is True, "Upload should be successful"
    assert result.file_id is not None, "File ID should be returned"
    assert result.size_bytes > 0, "File size should be greater than 0"

    print(f"Uploaded: {result.filename}")
    print(f"File ID: {result.file_id}")
    print(f"Size: {result.size_bytes} bytes")
    print(f"Status: {result.processing_status}")
finally:
    # Clean up temp file
    os.unlink(temp_path)
```

### Upload with Scope Values

Add metadata to your files using scope values:

```python
import tempfile
import os

with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode='w', suffix='.txt', delete=False) as f:
    f.write("Test document with scope values")
    temp_path = f.name

try:
    result = trainly.upload_file(
        temp_path,
        scope_values={
            "test_category": "sdk_testing",
            "test_id": "test_123"
        }
    )

    assert result.success is True, "Upload should be successful"
    print("File uploaded with scope values")
finally:
    os.unlink(temp_path)
```

### Upload Text Content

```python
# Upload raw text without a file
result = trainly.upload_text(
    content="This is my document content. It contains important information...",
    name="My Notes.txt",
    scope_values={
        "type": "notes",
        "date": "2024-01-15"
    }
)

print(f"Text uploaded as: {result.filename}")
```

### Bulk Upload

```python
from pathlib import Path
from typing import List

# Find all PDF files
pdf_files = list(Path("./documents").rglob("*.pdf"))

results = trainly.upload_bulk(
    files=[
        {
            "file": open(path, "rb"),
            "filename": path.name,
            "scope_values": {
                "source": "research",
                "upload_date": "2024-01-15"
            }
        }
        for path in pdf_files
    ],
    on_progress=lambda completed, total: print(f"Progress: {completed}/{total}")
)

print(f"Success: {results.successful_uploads}/{results.total_files}")

# Check for failures
for result in results.results:
    if not result.success:
        print(f"Failed: {result.filename} - {result.error}")
```

### Bulk Upload with Progress Bar

```python
from trainly import TrainlyClient
from tqdm import tqdm
from pathlib import Path

trainly = TrainlyClient(
    api_key="tk_your_api_key",
    chat_id="chat_abc123"
)

# Get all PDF files
pdf_files = list(Path("./documents").rglob("*.pdf"))

# Upload with progress bar
results = []
with tqdm(total=len(pdf_files), desc="Uploading files") as pbar:
    for pdf_path in pdf_files:
        try:
            with open(pdf_path, "rb") as file:
                result = trainly.upload_file(
                    file=file,
                    filename=pdf_path.name,
                    scope_values={"source": "batch_upload"}
                )
                results.append({"file": pdf_path.name, "success": True})
        except Exception as e:
            results.append({"file": pdf_path.name, "success": False, "error": str(e)})
        finally:
            pbar.update(1)

# Summary
successful = sum(1 for r in results if r["success"])
print(f"\nUploaded {successful}/{len(results)} files successfully")
```

### Upload from URL

```python
import requests
from io import BytesIO

def upload_from_url(url: str, filename: str):
    """Download file from URL and upload to Trainly"""

    # Download file
    response = requests.get(url, stream=True)
    response.raise_for_status()

    # Get file content
    file_content = BytesIO(response.content)

    # Upload to Trainly
    result = trainly.upload_file(
        file=file_content,
        filename=filename,
        scope_values={
            "source": "url",
            "original_url": url
        }
    )

    return result

# Usage
result = upload_from_url(
    "https://example.com/research_paper.pdf",
    "research_paper.pdf"
)

print(f"Uploaded from URL: {result.filename}")
```

### Upload with Validation

```python
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Optional
import mimetypes

class FileValidator:
    """Validate files before uploading"""

    MAX_SIZE = 5 * 1024 * 1024  # 5MB
    ALLOWED_TYPES = {
        'application/pdf',
        'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document',
        'text/plain',
        'text/markdown',
        'application/json'
    }

    @classmethod
    def validate(cls, file_path: Path) -> tuple[bool, Optional[str]]:
        """Validate file before upload"""

        # Check if file exists
        if not file_path.exists():
            return False, f"File not found: {file_path}"

        # Check file size
        file_size = file_path.stat().st_size
        if file_size > cls.MAX_SIZE:
            return False, f"File too large: {file_size / 1024 / 1024:.1f}MB (max 5MB)"

        # Check MIME type
        mime_type, _ = mimetypes.guess_type(str(file_path))
        if mime_type not in cls.ALLOWED_TYPES:
            return False, f"Unsupported file type: {mime_type}"

        return True, None

# Usage with validation
def safe_upload(file_path: str):
    """Upload with validation"""
    path = Path(file_path)

    # Validate before upload
    is_valid, error = FileValidator.validate(path)

    if not is_valid:
        print(f"Validation failed: {error}")
        return None

    # Upload if valid
    try:
        with open(path, "rb") as file:
            result = trainly.upload_file(
                file=file,
                filename=path.name
            )

        print(f"✓ Uploaded: {result.filename}")
        return result

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"✗ Upload failed: {e}")
        return None

# Example
result = safe_upload("./documents/research.pdf")
```

### Upload with Checksum Verification

```python
import hashlib
from pathlib import Path

def calculate_md5(file_path: Path) -> str:
    """Calculate MD5 checksum of file"""
    md5_hash = hashlib.md5()

    with open(file_path, "rb") as f:
        for chunk in iter(lambda: f.read(4096), b""):
            md5_hash.update(chunk)

    return md5_hash.hexdigest()

def upload_with_checksum(file_path: str, expected_checksum: str = None):
    """Upload file with checksum verification"""
    path = Path(file_path)

    # Calculate checksum
    actual_checksum = calculate_md5(path)
    print(f"File checksum: {actual_checksum}")

    # Verify if expected checksum provided
    if expected_checksum and actual_checksum != expected_checksum:
        raise ValueError(
            f"Checksum mismatch! Expected {expected_checksum}, got {actual_checksum}"
        )

    # Upload file
    with open(path, "rb") as file:
        result = trainly.upload_file(
            file=file,
            filename=path.name,
            scope_values={
                "checksum": actual_checksum,
                "verified": expected_checksum is not None
            }
        )

    print(f"✓ Uploaded with verified checksum: {result.filename}")
    return result

# Usage
result = upload_with_checksum(
    "./important_document.pdf",
    expected_checksum="abc123def456..."
)
```

### Upload with Retry Logic

```python
import time
from typing import Optional

def upload_with_retry(
    file_path: str,
    max_attempts: int = 3,
    retry_delay: float = 1.0
) -> Optional[any]:
    """Upload file with automatic retry on failure"""

    for attempt in range(1, max_attempts + 1):

                )

            print(f"✓ Upload successful on attempt {attempt}")
            return result

        except Exception as e:

            if attempt < max_attempts:
                # Exponential backoff
                wait_time = retry_delay * (2 ** (attempt - 1))
                print(f"Waiting {wait_time:.1f}s before retry...")
                time.sleep(wait_time)
            else:
                print(f"Failed after {max_attempts} attempts")
                raise

# Usage
try:
    result = upload_with_retry(
        "./research.pdf",
        max_attempts=3,
        retry_delay=2.0
    )
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Upload permanently failed: {e}")
```

### Upload Directory Structure

```python
from pathlib import Path
from collections import defaultdict

def upload_directory(
    directory: str,
    preserve_structure: bool = True,
    file_extensions: list = None
):
    """Upload all files from a directory"""

    dir_path = Path(directory)

    if not dir_path.is_dir():

### List Files

```python
# Get all files in chat

### List Files with Validation

Verify list results and handle edge cases:

```python

print(f"✓ List files successful")
print(f"  Total files: {result.total_files}")
print(f"  Total size: {result.total_size_bytes} bytes")

if result.files:
    print(f"  Sample file: {result.files[0].filename}")
    print(f"    - File ID: {result.files[0].file_id}")
    print(f"    - Size: {result.files[0].size_bytes} bytes")
    print(f"    - Chunks: {result.files[0].chunk_count}")

    # Get a file ID for deletion if needed
    file_id = result.files[0].file_id
else:
    print("  No files found")
    file_id = None
```

### Advanced File Filtering

    uploaded_after=datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7)
)

# Get small text files
small_texts = list_files_with_filters(
    max_size=100 * 1024,  # < 100KB
    extensions=['.txt', '.md']
)

print(f"Found {len(large_pdfs)} large PDFs")
print(f"Found {len(recent_files)} recent files")
print(f"Found {len(small_texts)} small text files")
```

### Delete Files

```python
# Delete a specific file
result = trainly.delete_file("v1_user_xyz_doc_123")

print(f"Deleted: {result.filename}")
print(f"Freed: {format_bytes(result.size_bytes_freed)}")
print(f"Chunks removed: {result.chunks_deleted}")

# Delete multiple files
file_ids = ["file_1", "file_2", "file_3"]

for file_id in file_ids:
    try:
        result = trainly.delete_file(file_id)
        print(f"✓ Deleted {result.filename}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"✗ Failed to delete {file_id}: {e}")

    # Rate limiting delay
    import time
    time.sleep(0.1)
```

### Delete File with Validation

Validate deletion results and handle missing files:

```python
from trainly import TrainlyClient, FileDeleteResult

trainly = TrainlyClient(
    api_key="tk_your_api_key",
    chat_id="chat_abc123"
)

file_id = "v1_user_xyz_doc_123"  # Your file ID

if not file_id:
    print("Skipping delete test - no file ID available")
else:
    try:
        result = trainly.delete_file(file_id)

        # Validate deletion
        assert isinstance(result, FileDeleteResult), "Result should be FileDeleteResult"
        assert result.success is True, "Delete should be successful"

        print(f"✓ File deleted successfully")
        print(f"  Deleted file: {result.filename}")
        print(f"  Chunks deleted: {result.chunks_deleted}")
        print(f"  Size freed: {result.size_bytes_freed} bytes")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"✗ Delete file failed: {e}")
```

## V1 OAuth Authentication

### Setup V1 Client

```python
from trainly import TrainlyV1Client

# User authenticates with your OAuth provider (Clerk, Auth0, etc.)
user_oauth_token = get_oauth_token()  # Your implementation

# Initialize V1 client
trainly = TrainlyV1Client(
    user_token=user_oauth_token,
    app_id="app_your_app_id"
)

# Query user's private data
response = trainly.query(
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What documents do I have?"}
    ],
    response_tokens=200
)

print("Answer:", response.answer)
print("Privacy guarantee:", response.privacy_guarantee)
```

### V1 File Operations

```python
# Upload file to user's private subchat
with open("user_document.pdf", "rb") as file:
    upload_result = trainly.upload_file(
        file=file,
        scope_values={
            "playlist_id": "playlist_123",
            "genre": "rock"
        }
    )

print("Uploaded to user subchat:", upload_result.chat_id)

# List user's files
files = trainly.list_files()
for file in files.files:
    print(f"{file.filename} - {format_bytes(file.size_bytes)}")

# Delete user's file
result = trainly.delete_file(file_id)
print(f"Deleted: {result.filename}")
```

## Python-Specific Patterns

### Decorators for Common Tasks

```python

### Property-Based Testing

```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st
from trainly import TrainlyClient

    api_key=os.getenv("TRAINLY_TEST_API_KEY"),
    chat_id=os.getenv("TRAINLY_TEST_CHAT_ID")

    """Property test: query should handle any valid string"""
    try:

        # Properties that should always be true
        assert isinstance(response.answer, str)
        assert len(response.answer) > 0
        assert isinstance(response.context, list)
        assert response.usage.total_tokens > 0

    except Exception as e:
        # Some strings might be rejected (empty, too long, etc.)
        # But the error should be a known type
        assert isinstance(e, (ValidationError, ValueError))

# Run the test with 100 random strings
test_query_handles_any_string()
```

### Custom Context Manager

```python

        self.credits_used += credits

        return response

# Usage

### Protocol Pattern for Extensibility

```python
from typing import Protocol, runtime_checkable
from abc import abstractmethod

@runtime_checkable
class FileUploader(Protocol):
    """Protocol for file upload implementations"""

    @abstractmethod
    def upload(self, file, filename: str, **kwargs):
        """Upload a file"""
        pass

class TrainlyUploader:
    """Trainly implementation of FileUploader"""

    def __init__(self, trainly_client: TrainlyClient):
        self.trainly = trainly_client

    def upload(self, file, filename: str, **kwargs):
        return self.trainly.upload_file(
            file=file,
            filename=filename,
            **kwargs
        )

class MockUploader:
    """Mock uploader for testing"""

    def upload(self, file, filename: str, **kwargs):
        print(f"Mock upload: {filename}")
        return {"filename": filename, "success": True}

def process_documents(
    files: list,
    uploader: FileUploader  # Any class that implements the protocol
):
    """Process documents with any uploader implementation"""

    results = []
    for file_path in files:
        with open(file_path, "rb") as file:
            result = uploader.upload(
                file=file,
                filename=Path(file_path).name
            )
        results.append(result)

    return results

# Usage with Trainly
trainly_uploader = TrainlyUploader(trainly)
results = process_documents(["./doc1.pdf", "./doc2.pdf"], trainly_uploader)

# Usage with mock (for testing)
mock_uploader = MockUploader()
results = process_documents(["./doc1.pdf", "./doc2.pdf"], mock_uploader)
```

## Error Handling

### Basic Error Handling

```python
from trainly import (
    TrainlyClient,
    TrainlyError,
    RateLimitError,
    AuthenticationError,
    ValidationError
)

trainly = TrainlyClient(
    api_key="tk_your_api_key",
    chat_id="chat_abc123"
)

try:
    response = trainly.query(
        question="What is the conclusion?"
    )
    print(response.answer)

except RateLimitError as e:
    print(f"Rate limit exceeded. Retry after: {e.retry_after} seconds")
    # Wait and retry
    import time
    time.sleep(e.retry_after)

except AuthenticationError as e:
    print(f"Authentication failed: {e}")
    # Refresh API key or re-login

except ValidationError as e:
    print(f"Invalid request: {e}")
    print(f"Details: {e.details}")

except TrainlyError as e:
    print(f"Trainly API error: {e}")
    print(f"Status code: {e.status}")

except Exception as e:
    print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
```

### Error Handling for File Operations

Handle errors specific to file operations:

```python
from trainly import TrainlyClient, TrainlyError
import os

trainly = TrainlyClient(
    api_key="tk_your_api_key",
    chat_id="chat_abc123"
)

# Test 1: Empty file ID for delete
try:
    trainly.delete_file("")
    print("Should have raised error for empty file ID")
except TrainlyError as e:
    print(f"Correctly raised error for empty file ID: {e}")

# Test 2: Non-existent file upload
try:
    trainly.upload_file("/nonexistent/file.pdf")
    print("Should have raised error for non-existent file")
except TrainlyError as e:
    print(f"Correctly raised error for non-existent file: {e}")
except FileNotFoundError as e:
    print(f"File not found: {e}")
```

### Validating Upload Results

Always verify upload success:

```python
from trainly import TrainlyClient, UploadResult

trainly = TrainlyClient(
    api_key="tk_your_api_key",
    chat_id="chat_abc123"
)

result = trainly.upload_file("document.pdf")

# Verify upload was successful
assert isinstance(result, UploadResult), "Result should be UploadResult"
assert result.success is True, "Upload should be successful"
assert result.file_id is not None, "File ID should be returned"
assert result.size_bytes > 0, "File size should be greater than 0"

print(f"✓ Upload successful: {result.filename}")
print(f"  File ID: {result.file_id}")
print(f"  Size: {result.size_bytes} bytes")
print(f"  Status: {result.processing_status}")
```

### Retry Decorator

```python
import time
from functools import wraps
from trainly import RateLimitError, TrainlyError

def retry_on_rate_limit(max_attempts=3):
    """Decorator to automatically retry on rate limits"""
    def decorator(func):
        @wraps(func)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            for attempt in range(max_attempts):
                try:
                    return func(*args, **kwargs)

                except RateLimitError as e:
                    if attempt < max_attempts - 1:
                        wait_time = e.retry_after or (2 ** attempt)
                        print(f"Rate limited. Waiting {wait_time}s...")
                        time.sleep(wait_time)
                    else:
                        raise

                except TrainlyError as e:
                    if attempt < max_attempts - 1 and e.status >= 500:
                        wait_time = 2 ** attempt
                        print(f"Server error. Retrying in {wait_time}s...")
                        time.sleep(wait_time)
                    else:
                        raise

        return wrapper
    return decorator

# Usage
@retry_on_rate_limit(max_attempts=3)
def query_with_retry(question: str):
    return trainly.query(question=question)

response = query_with_retry("What are the findings?")
```

### Context Manager

The `TrainlyClient` supports Python's context manager protocol for automatic resource cleanup:

```python
from trainly import TrainlyClient
import os

# Use context manager for automatic cleanup
with TrainlyClient(
    api_key=os.getenv("TRAINLY_API_KEY"),
    chat_id=os.getenv("TRAINLY_CHAT_ID")
) as trainly:
    response = trainly.query(
        question="What is the result?"
    )
    print(response.answer)

# Connection automatically closed when exiting the context
```

### Context Manager with Multiple Operations

You can perform multiple operations within a single context:

```python
from trainly import TrainlyClient
import os

with TrainlyClient(
    api_key=os.getenv("TRAINLY_API_KEY"),
    chat_id=os.getenv("TRAINLY_CHAT_ID")
) as trainly:
    # Upload a file
    with open("document.pdf", "rb") as f:
        upload_result = trainly.upload_file(f, filename="document.pdf")

    # Query about the uploaded content
    response = trainly.query("What is in the document?")
    print(response.answer)

    # List files
    files = trainly.list_files()
    print(f"Total files: {files.total_files}")

    # Delete the file
    delete_result = trainly.delete_file(upload_result.file_id)
    print(f"Deleted: {delete_result.filename}")
```

## Advanced Features

### Async Support

```python
import asyncio
from trainly import AsyncTrainlyClient

async def main():
    trainly = AsyncTrainlyClient(
        api_key="tk_your_api_key",
        chat_id="chat_abc123"
    )

    # Async query
    response = await trainly.query(
        question="What are the findings?"
    )

    print(response.answer)

    # Async streaming
    async for chunk in trainly.query_stream(
        question="Summarize the results"
    ):
        if chunk.type == "content":
            print(chunk.data, end="", flush=True)
        elif chunk.type == "end":
            print("\n\nComplete!")

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Concurrent Queries

```python
import asyncio
from trainly import AsyncTrainlyClient

async def batch_queries():
    trainly = AsyncTrainlyClient(
        api_key="tk_your_api_key",
        chat_id="chat_abc123"
    )

    questions = [
        "What is the introduction about?",
        "What is the methodology?",
        "What are the conclusions?",
        "What are the limitations?"
    ]

    # Run queries concurrently
    tasks = [
        trainly.query(question=q)
        for q in questions
    ]

    responses = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

    for question, response in zip(questions, responses):
        print(f"\nQ: {question}")
        print(f"A: {response.answer[:200]}...")

asyncio.run(batch_queries())
```

### Rate Limiting

```python
from trainly import RateLimiter
import time

# Create rate limiter (60 requests per minute)
limiter = RateLimiter(
    max_requests=60,
    window_seconds=60
)

def rate_limited_query(question: str):
    # Wait if necessary
    limiter.wait_for_slot()

    # Make request
    return trainly.query(question=question)

# Use it
response = rate_limited_query("What is the conclusion?")
```

### Caching

```python
from functools import lru_cache
from trainly import TrainlyClient
import hashlib

trainly = TrainlyClient(
    api_key="tk_your_api_key",
    chat_id="chat_abc123"
)

@lru_cache(maxsize=100)
def cached_query(question: str, model: str = "gpt-4o-mini"):
    """Cache query results"""
    response = trainly.query(
        question=question,
        model=model
    )
    return response

# First call - hits API
response1 = cached_query("What is the conclusion?")

# Second call - returns cached result
response2 = cached_query("What is the conclusion?")

# Different question - hits API
response3 = cached_query("What is the methodology?")
```

### Advanced Caching with TTL

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from typing import Dict, Tuple, Any

class QueryCache:
    def __init__(self, ttl_seconds: int = 300):
        self.cache: Dict[str, Tuple[Any, datetime]] = {}
        self.ttl = timedelta(seconds=ttl_seconds)

    def get(self, question: str):
        if question in self.cache:
            value, timestamp = self.cache[question]
            if datetime.now() - timestamp < self.ttl:
                return value
            else:
                del self.cache[question]
        return None

    def set(self, question: str, value: Any):
        self.cache[question] = (value, datetime.now())

    def clear(self):
        self.cache.clear()

# Usage
cache = QueryCache(ttl_seconds=300)  # 5 minute TTL

def cached_query(question: str):
    # Check cache
    cached = cache.get(question)
    if cached:
        print("Cache hit!")
        return cached

    # Query API
    response = trainly.query(question=question)

    # Store in cache
    cache.set(question, response)

    return response
```

```

## Logging & Debugging

### Enable Debug Mode

```python
import logging
from trainly import TrainlyClient

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.DEBUG,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
)

# Enable debug mode
trainly = TrainlyClient(
    api_key="tk_your_api_key",
    chat_id="chat_abc123",
    debug=True
)

# All API calls will be logged
response = trainly.query(question="What is the result?")
```

### Custom Logger

```python
import logging
from trainly import TrainlyClient

# Create custom logger
logger = logging.getLogger("trainly_app")
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

# Add file handler
file_handler = logging.FileHandler("trainly.log")
file_handler.setFormatter(
    logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
)
logger.addHandler(file_handler)

# Use custom logger
trainly = TrainlyClient(
    api_key="tk_your_api_key",
    chat_id="chat_abc123",
    logger=logger
)
```

### Request/Response Logging

```python
from trainly import TrainlyClient
import json

class LoggingTrainlyClient(TrainlyClient):
    def query(self, **kwargs):
        # Log request
        print("=" * 50)
        print("REQUEST:")
        print(json.dumps(kwargs, indent=2))

        # Make request

## File Lifecycle Management

### Complete File Lifecycle

Manage the complete lifecycle of a file: upload, query, verify, and delete:

```python
from trainly import TrainlyClient
import tempfile
import os
import time

trainly = TrainlyClient(
    api_key="tk_your_api_key",
    chat_id="chat_abc123"
)

# Step 1: Upload
with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode='w', suffix='.txt', delete=False) as f:
    f.write("Lifecycle test document content")
    temp_path = f.name

try:
    upload_result = trainly.upload_file(temp_path)
    file_id = upload_result.file_id
    print(f"✓ Uploaded file: {upload_result.filename}")

    # Step 2: List and verify
    list_result = trainly.list_files()
    file_ids = [f.file_id for f in list_result.files]
    assert file_id in file_ids, "File should appear in list"
    print("✓ File appears in file list")

    # Step 3: Query about the file
    response = trainly.query("What is in the test document?")
    print("✓ Query successful after upload")
    print(f"  Answer: {response.answer[:100]}...")

    # Step 4: Delete
    delete_result = trainly.delete_file(file_id)
    assert delete_result.success is True
    print("✓ File deleted successfully")
    print(f"  Chunks deleted: {delete_result.chunks_deleted}")
    print(f"  Size freed: {delete_result.size_bytes_freed} bytes")

finally:
    os.unlink(temp_path)
```

### Query Specific File Content

Upload a file with specific content and verify the AI can answer questions about it:

```python
from trainly import TrainlyClient

trainly = TrainlyClient(
    api_key="tk_your_api_key",
    chat_id="chat_abc123"
)

# Create a file with very specific information
specific_content = """

### Cleanup Before Testing

Start with a clean slate by deleting all existing files:

```python
from trainly import TrainlyClient

    api_key="tk_your_api_key",
    chat_id="chat_abc123"
)

# Clean up: Delete all existing files

list_result = trainly.list_files()

if list_result.files:
    for file_info in list_result.files:
        try:
            trainly.delete_file(file_info.file_id)
            print(f"  Deleted: {file_info.filename}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"  Could not delete {file_info.filename}: {e}")
    print(f"✓ Cleaned up {len(list_result.files)} existing files")
else:
    print("No existing files to clean up")

# Wait for deletions to propagate
import time
time.sleep(5)

# Now you can start fresh with your test files
```

### Jupyter Notebook Integration

```python
# In Jupyter Notebook
from trainly import TrainlyClient
import pandas as pd
from IPython.display import display, Markdown

trainly = TrainlyClient(
    api_key="tk_your_api_key",
    chat_id="chat_abc123"

```

## Testing and Verification

### Testing Query Responses

Verify that queries return expected results:

```python
from trainly import TrainlyClient, QueryResponse

trainly = TrainlyClient(
    api_key="tk_your_api_key",
    chat_id="chat_abc123"
)

# Test basic query
response = trainly.query("What is the main topic?")

# Validate response structure
assert isinstance(response, QueryResponse), "Response should be QueryResponse"
assert hasattr(response, 'answer'), "Response should have answer"
assert isinstance(response.answer, str), "Answer should be a string"
assert len(response.answer) > 0, "Answer should not be empty"

print(f"✓ Query successful")
print(f"  Answer length: {len(response.answer)} characters")
print(f"  Context chunks: {len(response.context)}")

if response.usage:
    print(f"  Token usage: {response.usage.total_tokens} total tokens")
```

### Testing File Operations

Test the complete file operation workflow:

```python
from trainly import TrainlyClient
import tempfile
import os

trainly = TrainlyClient(
    api_key="tk_your_api_key",
    chat_id="chat_abc123"
)

# Create test file
with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode='w', suffix='.txt', delete=False) as f:
    f.write("Test document for SDK testing.\n")
    f.write("Contains test content.")
    temp_path = f.name

try:
    # Test upload
    upload_result = trainly.upload_file(temp_path)
    assert upload_result.success is True
    assert upload_result.file_id is not None
    print(f"✓ Upload test passed: {upload_result.filename}")

    # Test list
    list_result = trainly.list_files()
    assert upload_result.file_id in [f.file_id for f in list_result.files]
    print(f"✓ List test passed: Found {list_result.total_files} files")

    # Test query
    query_response = trainly.query("What is in the test document?")
    assert len(query_response.answer) > 0
    print(f"✓ Query test passed: Got answer")

    # Test delete
    delete_result = trainly.delete_file(upload_result.file_id)
    assert delete_result.success is True
    print(f"✓ Delete test passed: {delete_result.filename}")

    print("\n✓ All file operation tests passed!")

finally:
    os.unlink(temp_path)
```

### Testing Streaming Queries

Verify streaming functionality:

```python
from trainly import TrainlyClient

trainly = TrainlyClient(
    api_key="tk_your_api_key",
    chat_id="chat_abc123"
)

chunks = []
content_parts = []

for chunk in trainly.query_stream("Explain the methodology"):
    chunks.append(chunk)
    if chunk.is_content:
        content_parts.append(chunk.data)
    elif chunk.is_end:
        print("Received end marker")

# Verify streaming results
assert len(chunks) > 0, "Should receive at least one chunk"
assert any(chunk.is_end for chunk in chunks), "Should receive end marker"

full_content = "".join(content_parts)
assert len(full_content) > 0, "Should receive content"

print(f"✓ Streaming test passed")
print(f"  Total chunks: {len(chunks)}")
print(f"  Content length: {len(full_content)} characters")
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests

```python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch
from trainly import TrainlyClient, QueryResponse

class TestTrainlyIntegration(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.trainly = TrainlyClient(
            api_key="tk_test_key",
            chat_id="chat_test_123"
        )

    @patch('trainly.client.requests.post')
    def test_query(self, mock_post):
        # Mock response
        mock_post.return_value.json.return_value = {
            "answer": "Test answer",
            "context": [],
            "chat_id": "chat_test_123",
            "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
            "usage": {
                "prompt_tokens": 10,
                "completion_tokens": 20,
                "total_tokens": 30
            }
        }
        mock_post.return_value.status_code = 200

        # Test query
        response = self.trainly.query(question="Test question")

        self.assertEqual(response.answer, "Test answer")
        self.assertEqual(response.model, "gpt-4o-mini")

    def test_query_validation(self):
        # Test empty question
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            self.trainly.query(question="")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

### Integration Tests

```python
import pytest
from trainly import TrainlyClient
import os

@pytest.fixture
def trainly_client():
    return TrainlyClient(
        api_key=os.getenv("TRAINLY_TEST_API_KEY"),
        chat_id=os.getenv("TRAINLY_TEST_CHAT_ID")
    )

def test_query_basic(trainly_client):
    response = trainly_client.query(
        question="What is 2+2?"
    )

    assert response.answer
    assert response.chat_id
    assert response.usage.total_tokens > 0

def test_query_with_scopes(trainly_client):
    response = trainly_client.query(
        question="Test question",
        scope_filters={"project_id": "test_proj"}
    )

    assert response.answer

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_async_query():
    from trainly import AsyncTrainlyClient

    trainly = AsyncTrainlyClient(
        api_key=os.getenv("TRAINLY_TEST_API_KEY"),
        chat_id=os.getenv("TRAINLY_TEST_CHAT_ID")
    )

    response = await trainly.query(question="Test")

    assert response.answer
```

## Practical Usage Patterns

### Waiting for File Processing

After uploading a file, wait for it to be processed before querying:

```python
from trainly import TrainlyClient
import time

trainly = TrainlyClient(
    api_key="tk_your_api_key",
    chat_id="chat_abc123"
)

# Upload a file
result = trainly.upload_file("document.pdf")
file_id = result.file_id

print(f"Uploaded: {result.filename}")
print("Waiting for file processing...")

# Wait for processing (typically 10-30 seconds)
time.sleep(30)

print("File processed and indexed, ready for queries!")

# Now you can query about the file
response = trainly.query("What is in the document?")
print(response.answer)
```

### Handling File Processing Status

Check processing status and wait until complete:

```python
from trainly import TrainlyClient
import time

trainly = TrainlyClient(
    api_key="tk_your_api_key",
    chat_id="chat_abc123"
)

result = trainly.upload_file("document.pdf")

print(f"Upload status: {result.processing_status}")

# Wait for processing with status checks
max_wait = 60  # Maximum wait time in seconds
wait_interval = 5  # Check every 5 seconds
elapsed = 0

while elapsed < max_wait:
    files = trainly.list_files()
    file_info = next((f for f in files.files if f.file_id == result.file_id), None)

    if file_info and file_info.chunk_count > 0:
        print("✓ File processed and indexed!")
        break

    print(f"Waiting... ({elapsed}s elapsed)")
    time.sleep(wait_interval)
    elapsed += wait_interval
else:
    print("⚠ File processing taking longer than expected")
```

### Complete Workflow Example

A complete example showing the full workflow from initialization to querying:

```python

if not api_key or not chat_id:
    raise ValueError("TRAINLY_API_KEY and TRAINLY_CHAT_ID must be set")

client = TrainlyClient(api_key=api_key, chat_id=chat_id)
print(f"✓ Client initialized with chat_id: {client.chat_id}")

# Create test document
test_content = """

    print(f"✓ Uploaded: {upload_result.filename}")

    # Wait for processing
    print("Waiting for file processing...")
    time.sleep(30)

    # Query about the content
    response = client.query("What is the price of the UltraSound Pro 5000?")
    assert "$349" in response.answer or "349" in response.answer
    print(f"✓ Query verified: {response.answer[:100]}...")

    # List files
    files = client.list_files()
    assert file_id in [f.file_id for f in files.files]
    print(f"✓ File found in list: {files.total_files} total files")

    # Delete file

except TrainlyError as e:

finally:
    # Cleanup

        except:
            pass
```

### Error Handling in Production

Robust error handling for production use:

```python
from trainly import TrainlyClient, TrainlyError
import os
import time
from typing import Optional

def safe_query(client: TrainlyClient, question: str, max_retries: int = 3) -> Optional[str]:
    """Query with automatic retry on failure"""
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            response = client.query(question=question)
            return response.answer
        except TrainlyError as e:
            if attempt < max_retries - 1:
                wait_time = 2 ** attempt  # Exponential backoff
                print(f"Attempt {attempt + 1} failed: {e}. Retrying in {wait_time}s...")
                time.sleep(wait_time)
            else:
                print(f"Failed after {max_retries} attempts: {e}")
                return None
    return None

def safe_upload(client: TrainlyClient, file_path: str) -> Optional[str]:
    """Upload file with error handling"""
    try:
        result = client.upload_file(file_path)
        if result.success:
            return result.file_id
        else:
            print(f"Upload failed: {result}")
            return None
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"File not found: {file_path}")
        return None
    except TrainlyError as e:
        print(f"Upload error: {e}")
        return None

# Usage
client = TrainlyClient(
    api_key=os.getenv("TRAINLY_API_KEY"),
    chat_id=os.getenv("TRAINLY_CHAT_ID")
)

# Safe query
answer = safe_query(client, "What are the main findings?")
if answer:
    print(f"Answer: {answer}")

# Safe upload
file_id = safe_upload(client, "document.pdf")
if file_id:
    print(f"Uploaded file ID: {file_id}")
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Environment Variables">
    Always use environment variables for credentials:

    ```python
    # .env file
    TRAINLY_API_KEY=tk_your_api_key
    TRAINLY_CHAT_ID=chat_abc123

    # Load with python-dotenv
    from dotenv import load_dotenv
    import os

    load_dotenv()

    trainly = TrainlyClient(
        api_key=os.getenv("TRAINLY_API_KEY"),
        chat_id=os.getenv("TRAINLY_CHAT_ID")
    )
    ```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Connection Pooling">
    Reuse client instances for better performance:

    ```python
    # ✅ GOOD - Reuse client
    trainly = TrainlyClient(api_key="...", chat_id="...")

    for question in questions:
        response = trainly.query(question=question)

    # ❌ BAD - Create new client each time
    for question in questions:
        trainly = TrainlyClient(api_key="...", chat_id="...")
        response = trainly.query(question=question)
    ```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Async for Performance">
    Use async client for concurrent operations:

    ```python
    import asyncio
    from trainly import AsyncTrainlyClient

    async def process_many_queries(questions):
        trainly = AsyncTrainlyClient(...)

        # Run concurrently
        tasks = [
            trainly.query(question=q)
            for q in questions
        ]

        return await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    ```

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Import Errors">
    ```bash
    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'trainly'
    ```

    **Solution**: Install the SDK
    ```bash
    pip install trainly
    ```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Authentication Errors">
    ```
    AuthenticationError: Invalid API key
    ```

    **Solutions**:
    - Check API key starts with `tk_`
    - Verify API access is enabled in chat settings
    - Ensure chat has published settings

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Empty Responses">
    ```python
    response.answer == "I don't have any context..."
    ```

    **Solutions**:
    - Upload documents to the chat
    - Check published settings include context files
    - Verify scope filters aren't too restrictive

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rate Limit Errors">
    ```
    RateLimitError: Rate limit exceeded
    ```

    **Solutions**:
    - Implement exponential backoff
    - Use caching for common queries
    - Consider upgrading your plan
