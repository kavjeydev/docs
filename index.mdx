## What is Trainly?

Trainly is a **GraphRAG (Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** platform that enables you to build intelligent applications powered by your own documents. Upload files, and Trainly creates a searchable knowledge graph that AI models can query with accurate, citation-backed answers.

<Note>
  **Privacy-First Architecture**: User data is completely isolated. Developers get AI responses only—never raw files or documents.

## Example: Building a Document Q&A System

Here's a complete example in under 50 lines:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript Next.js
// app/api/query/route.ts
import { TrainlyClient } from "@trainly/react";
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";

const trainly = new TrainlyClient({
  apiKey: process.env.TRAINLY_API_KEY!,
  chatId: process.env.TRAINLY_CHAT_ID!,
});

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { question } = await request.json();

  const response = await trainly.query({
    question,
    model: "gpt-4o-mini",
  });

  return NextResponse.json({
    answer: response.answer,
    citations: response.context.slice(0, 5),
  });
}
```

```python FastAPI
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from trainly import TrainlyClient
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

trainly = TrainlyClient(
    api_key=os.getenv("TRAINLY_API_KEY"),
    chat_id=os.getenv("TRAINLY_CHAT_ID")
)
