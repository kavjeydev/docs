## Build Your First AI-Powered Application

This guide will walk you through creating your first Trainly-powered application that can answer questions about your documents.

<Note>
  By the end of this guide, you'll have a working document Q&A system with less than 20 lines of code.
</Note>

## Step 1: Create Your Knowledge Base

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign Up">
    Create a free account at [trainlyai.com](https://trainlyai.com)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Chat">
    Click "New Chat" to create your first knowledge base
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload Documents">
    Upload PDFs, DOCX, TXT, or other documents. Trainly will automatically:
    - Extract text content
    - Create semantic chunks
    - Generate embeddings
    - Build a searchable graph
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test It">
    Try asking questions in the chat interface to verify your documents are indexed correctly
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Start with 2-3 documents to get familiar with the system. You can always add more later.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Enable API Access

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Settings">
    Click the settings icon in your chat
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Your Settings">
    - Choose your preferred AI model (GPT-4o-mini recommended)
    - Set temperature and max tokens
    - Add a custom prompt (optional)
    - Select which documents to include
  </Step>

  <Step title="Publish Settings">
    Click "Publish Settings" - this makes your configuration available to the API
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable API Access">
    Toggle "Enable API Access" and click "Generate API Key"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Copy Your Credentials">
    Save your API key (starts with `tk_`) and chat ID
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Keep your API key secret! Store it in environment variables, never commit it to source control.
</Warning>

## Step 3: Make Your First Query

Choose your preferred language and make your first API call:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
# Replace with your actual credentials
export TRAINLY_API_KEY="tk_your_api_key"
export TRAINLY_CHAT_ID="chat_abc123"

curl -X POST https://api.trainlyai.com/v1/${TRAINLY_CHAT_ID}/answer_question \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TRAINLY_API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "question": "What are the main points in my documents?"
  }'
```

```javascript JavaScript
// 1. Install the SDK
// npm install @trainly/react

// 2. Create a client
import { TrainlyClient } from "@trainly/react";

const trainly = new TrainlyClient({
  apiKey: process.env.TRAINLY_API_KEY,
  chatId: process.env.TRAINLY_CHAT_ID
});

// 3. Query your documents
const response = await trainly.query({
  question: "What are the main points in my documents?"
});

console.log("Answer:", response.answer);
console.log("Citations:", response.context.length);
```

```python Python
# 1. Install the SDK
# pip install trainly

# 2. Create a client
from trainly import TrainlyClient
import os

trainly = TrainlyClient(
    api_key=os.getenv("TRAINLY_API_KEY"),
    chat_id=os.getenv("TRAINLY_CHAT_ID")
)

# 3. Query your documents
response = trainly.query(
    question="What are the main points in my documents?"
)

print("Answer:", response.answer)
print("Citations:", len(response.context))
```

</CodeGroup>

## Step 4: Add Streaming (Optional)

Make your app more responsive with real-time streaming:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript JavaScript
// Stream responses in real-time
for await (const chunk of trainly.queryStream({
  question: "Explain the methodology in detail"
})) {
  if (chunk.type === 'content') {
    process.stdout.write(chunk.data);
  } else if (chunk.type === 'end') {
    console.log('\n\nComplete!');
  }
}
```

```python Python
# Stream responses in real-time
for chunk in trainly.query_stream(
    question="Explain the methodology in detail"
):
    if chunk.type == "content":
        print(chunk.data, end="", flush=True)
    elif chunk.type == "end":
        print("\n\nComplete!")
```

</CodeGroup>

## Common First Steps

### Upload More Documents

<CodeGroup>

```javascript JavaScript
const result = await trainly.uploadFile({
  file: './research_paper.pdf',
  scopeValues: {
    category: 'research',
    project_id: 'proj_123'
  }
});

console.log('Uploaded:', result.filename);
```

```python Python
with open('research_paper.pdf', 'rb') as file:
    result = trainly.upload_file(
        file=file,
        scope_values={
            'category': 'research',
            'project_id': 'proj_123'
        }
    )

print('Uploaded:', result.filename)
```

</CodeGroup>

### List Your Files

<CodeGroup>

```javascript JavaScript
const files = await trainly.listFiles();

console.log(`Total: ${files.total_files} files`);
files.files.forEach(file => {
  console.log(`- ${file.filename} (${file.chunk_count} chunks)`);
});
```

```python Python
files = trainly.list_files()

print(f"Total: {files.total_files} files")
for file in files.files:
    print(f"- {file.filename} ({file.chunk_count} chunks)")
```

</CodeGroup>

### Try Different Models

<CodeGroup>

```javascript JavaScript
// Fast and cheap
const response1 = await trainly.query({
  question: "Quick summary?",
  model: "gpt-4o-mini"  // 1x credits
});

// High quality
const response2 = await trainly.query({
  question: "Detailed analysis?",
  model: "gpt-4o"  // 15x credits
});
```

```python Python
# Fast and cheap
response1 = trainly.query(
    question="Quick summary?",
    model="gpt-4o-mini"  # 1x credits
)

# High quality
response2 = trainly.query(
    question="Detailed analysis?",
    model="gpt-4o"  # 15x credits
)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="API Key Not Working">
    **Check these:**
    - API key starts with `tk_`
    - API access is enabled in chat settings
    - Chat settings are published
    - Using correct chat ID

    **Solution:** Go to chat settings → Verify API access is enabled → Regenerate key if needed
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Empty or Generic Responses">
    **Possible causes:**
    - No documents uploaded
    - Documents not processed yet (takes 10-30 seconds)
    - Published settings don't include your documents
    - Question not relevant to your content

    **Solution:** Upload documents → Wait for processing → Publish settings with context files
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rate Limit Errors">
    **Default limits:**
    - 60 requests/minute per API key

    **Solution:** Implement exponential backoff in your retry logic or upgrade your plan
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Authentication Errors">
    **Check:**
    - API key is valid and not expired
    - Using correct authorization header format: `Authorization: Bearer tk_your_key`
    - Chat has API access enabled

    **Solution:** Verify credentials and regenerate API key if needed
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  **Pro Tip:** Start with `gpt-4o-mini` for development (1x credits), then switch to more powerful models like `gpt-4o` or `claude-3-opus` for production when you need higher quality responses.
